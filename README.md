# School-forum
This project aims to deliver a completely functional forum for VIA University College, where both students and employees can contribute with either asking or answering different questions or discussing relevant topics. Subforums will also be part of the app, where specific subjects will be discussed in different posts. These subforums will be created and moderated by an administrator of the application. Users can post with their credentials or anonymously. 
The motivation behind it stems from the unorganized manner in which questions are asked about student life, being spread all over the place (Facebooks groups, Discord servers and school web pages). This would make it easier to search for whatever topic you are interested in, and then all these answers and questions would be stored in the same place, making it easy for newcomers to simply get their answers straight away.
